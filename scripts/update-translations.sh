# Regenerate the catalogs from the qsTr() calls in qml/ and src/: harbour-salama.ts,
# the untranslated source catalog, and every harbour-salama-<lang>.ts beside it.
# One lupdate run over all of them, so a string added to the source shows up as
# unfinished in every language at once.
#
# The argument is the directory holding the catalogs, for ci/ to run this over a
# copy; the default is the tree's own.
#
# -locations none: with locations in, the catalog changes every time a line moves,
# so it would conflict on every unrelated edit and the check in ci/ would fail for
# no reason. Without them it changes only when the strings themselves do, which is
# the thing worth reviewing.
#
# -no-obsolete: a string that no longer exists in the source is dropped rather than
# kept as a tombstone. The catalog is regenerated from source, not maintained by
# hand.
#
# -extensions cpp,h,qml: left to itself lupdate follows src/reader/reader.qrc into
# Mozilla's Readability, which has no strings of ours and syntax its parser rejects.
#
# To add a language, write its header to translations/harbour-salama-<lang>.ts:
#
#     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
#     <!DOCTYPE TS>
#     <TS version="2.1" language="<lang>"></TS>
#
# and run this. lupdate fills in every string, with as many numerus forms as the
# language has. <lang> is what QTranslator matches against the reader's locale:
# `de` serves every German locale, `pt_BR` only Brazil.
